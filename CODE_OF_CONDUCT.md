## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

* **Learning focus**: Remember that education is our primary goal

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to:
- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct
- Ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful
- Ensure that educational quality standards are maintained

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include:
- Using an official project e-mail address
- Posting via an official social media account
- Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
- Referencing or discussing the project in other contexts

## Educational Mission

This repository serves an educational purpose, helping developers learn by building technologies from scratch. Our community standards should reflect this mission:

### For Contributors

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

The project team is obligated to:
- Maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident
- Investigate complaints promptly and fairly
- Take appropriate action based on the severity of the violation
- Communicate outcomes clearly when appropriate

### Enforcement Guidelines

The project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the project community.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by:
1. **Creating an issue** (for public matters that don't involve harassment)
2. **Contacting project maintainers** directly for sensitive matters
3. **Using GitHub's reporting features** for serious violations

When reporting, please include:
